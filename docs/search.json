As mentioned in the reading, there are different skill tracks of data scientists- engineering, analysis, and modeling/inference that have different specialties. I think all data scientists work with large & unclean datasets and spend time wrangling data to get it in a usable form. They also often work at companies and have to be able to have knowledge about the company/business and communicate their findings to those that may not have as much experience in data analysis and statistics. They often work on teams (either standalone, embedded, or integrated) to analyze data within a company. Data scientists solve specific questions using accurate and relevant data.\n2. What differences/similarities do you seen between data scientists and statisticians?\nSimilarities\n\nBoth deal with data!\nBoth deal with modeling data!\nBoth perform analysis on the data!\nBoth interpret data!\nBoth require mathematical and statistical knowledge!\n\nDifferences\n\nStatisticians deal with small, structured datasets whereas data scientists deal with large, messy datasets.\nData scientists spend a lot of time cleaning the data.\nStatisticians typically use models and “bring data to model” whereas data scientists “bring models to data”\n\n3. How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?\nPersonally, I am much more interested in the “statistician” side of things than the data scientist realm. Programming is not my specialty and dealing with large & messy datasets sounds like a headache. I prefer to spend more time on statistical analysis than wrangling the data. However, I recognize that cleaning data and using programming to do so is an extremely useful & marketable skill and so I’m excited to learn more about this."
